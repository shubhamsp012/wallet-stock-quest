## üéØ How to Use These Diagrams

### For Developers
- **Architecture Understanding**: Start with the Class Diagram to understand component structure
- **Feature Implementation**: Use Sequence Diagrams to understand interaction flows
- **State Management**: Refer to State Diagrams for component lifecycle
- **Business Logic**: Check Activity Diagrams for process flows

### For Project Managers
- **Feature Overview**: Use Case Diagram shows all system capabilities
- **User Flows**: Activity Diagrams illustrate user journeys
- **System Behavior**: Sequence Diagrams show how features work

### For Designers
- **User Interactions**: Activity and Sequence Diagrams show user flows
- **State Transitions**: State Diagrams help design UI state changes

## üîÑ Real-time Features

The application implements real-time updates every 45 seconds for:
- Stock prices in Portfolio
- Stock prices in Watchlist
- Stock prices in StockDetails
- Top Stocks display

## üíæ Database Schema
